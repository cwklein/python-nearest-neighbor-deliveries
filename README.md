<h1> Data Structures and Algorithms II </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
    This console-based application serves as the final project for Data Structures and Algorithms II at Western Governor's University.
    The basis of the project is to use a supervised machine learning algorithm to identify an acceptable delivery for a small delivery company.
    In the case of my own project, the method used was the nearest neighbor algorithm, resulting in a total mileage of 120.4 miles which was less than the minimum acceptable criterion of 140 miles.
    
    
</p>

<h2> Topic </h2>
<p>
    The project's topic is to take two csv files as input (a list of all packages, and a corresponding distance matrix of all locations) and generate/ execute an acceptable delivery path.
    In addition to keeping the total mileage under 140 miles, there are also several additional requirements that must be identified and satisfied from the package csv file (delivery deadline, specific truck, etc.).
</p>

<h2> Data </h2>
<p>
    The csv files used in this project has been supplied by WGU as part of a class assignment.
</p>

<h2> Development Environment </h2>
<p>
    Development was complete entirely within PyCharm Community Edition 2023.2 using python. The hardware used was just a standard PC running a 64-bit Windows 10 operating system. 
    No outside libraries or GUIâ€™s were utilized, instead using the system console space to allow for user input and navigation of various reports.
</p>

<h2> Directions </h2>
<p>
    To use the final application, execute Main.py and the program will complete the sorting and delivering before showing options in the console.
    Using this console, an individual can view statistics and metrics for every step of the delivery process to help evaluate efficiency.
